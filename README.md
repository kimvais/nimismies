This project aims to be easy-to-deploy certificate authority (CA) with a web based UI. It will run on Django and OpenSSL (via M2Crypto)

## Features

* None for the time being, really

In addition to the basic CA functionality (issuing Certificates!) I plan on
adding support for OSCP, SCEP and HSMs.
