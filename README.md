# nimismies

This project aims to be easy-to-deploy certificate authority (CA) with a web based UI. It will run on Django and OpenSSL (via M2Crypto)

## Instructions

### Installation

1. `git clone git://github.com/kimvais/nimismies.git`
1. `cd nimismies`
1. `make setup`

Make setup does the following:
1. `createdb nimismies`
1. `python manage.py syncdb`
1. `python manage.py migrate nimismies`
1. `./adduser.py <your email address>`

## Features

At the moment _nimismies_ is a minimally functional Certificate authority.

You can:

* Create CA keys (RSA only)
* Create CSRs for CA keys
* Generate self-signed certificates
* Upload CSRs
* Sign CSR using CA keys
* Download certificates

### TODO ###

In addition to the basic CA functionality (issuing Certificates!) I plan on
adding support for OSCP, SCEP and HSMs.

## Versioning

Version number is stored in settings.VERSION

The project is versioned with one form of semantic versioning. Versions are
not decimal, so x.y.9 will probably be followed by x.y.10

For 0.0.x version, each time a new functionality is in _working_ condition,
the 'patch' level will be bumped.

0.1.x will be
the first version that will be at least _remotely_ usable as a CA.
After that, each minor version bump will add actual features aiming for
a 1.0 release at some point in the distant future.
